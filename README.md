Perfect ðŸš€ â€” youâ€™ve shared the **actual Python script** you wrote for your supermarket sales data cleaning project.

Now, we can make a **README.md** that matches your script exactly, so if someone opens your repo, theyâ€™ll immediately understand what your project does.

Hereâ€™s a GitHub-ready README for your project:

# ðŸ›’ Supermarket Sales Data Cleaning Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project involves **cleaning and preprocessing supermarket sales data** to make it ready for **analysis, visualization, and reporting**.

The dataset contains raw sales records with missing values and inconsistencies.
Using **Pandas**, the dataset is cleaned, unnecessary columns are removed, missing values are handled, and the data is standardized for further analytics.

---

## ðŸ§¹ Cleaning Steps Implemented

1. **Load Data**

   * Imported the Excel dataset `supermarket_sales_with_nulls.xlsx`.

2. **Initial Exploration**

   * Checked shape, sample rows, column info, descriptive statistics, and missing values.

3. **Column Name Cleaning**

   * Standardized column names (lowercase, underscores, no spaces).

4. **Dropped Unnecessary Columns**

   * Removed `unitprice` as it was not needed for analysis.

5. **Handled Missing Values**

   * Filled categorical columns (`city`, `payment`) with **mode**.
   * Filled numerical column (`quantity`) with **median**.

6. **Converted Columns**

   * Converted `time` column to **datetime format**.

7. **Verification**

   * Checked missing values again to ensure dataset is clean.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries

* **Python 3**
* **Pandas**

## ðŸ“ˆ Output (Sample)

* Cleaned DataFrame with **no missing values**.
* Standardized column names.
* Dataset ready for visualization and reporting.

Example snippet of output:

```
   invoice_id branch   city customer_type gender product_line  quantity  total  payment       date        time
0  750-67-842      A  Yangon       Member   Male     Health         5   262.5   Cash   2019-01-05   2019-01-05

...
```

## ðŸ“Œ Future Enhancements

* Add **data visualization** with Matplotlib/Seaborn.
* Build a **Power BI / Tableau dashboard**.
* Automate the cleaning pipeline for new datasets.

---

## ðŸ™Œ Acknowledgements

* Dataset: Supermarket Sales Data (Kaggle or Excel source).
* Library: Pandas

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also **add Seaborn/Matplotlib visualization examples** (like sales by city, payment method, etc.) in the README so it looks more like a complete analytics project instead of just cleaning?
